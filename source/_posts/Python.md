# If...Else
*Conditions and If statements*
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
* Equals: a == b
* Not Equals: a != b
* Less than: a < b
* Less than or equal to: a <= b
* Greater than: a > b
* Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Example
If statement:
```shell
# Example
# If statement:

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
```

      
*Indentation*
Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. 
If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):

```shell
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error
```
